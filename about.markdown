This project aims to describe the history of the field of Natural Language Generation (NLG), as seen by NLG researchers themselves. Who and what inspired them to carry out their research? What was it like to study NLG in the early days of the field? How did the field develop? What were the centers of activity, and how did everyone interact with each other, outside of the different publication venues?

Through this website we will publish excerpts from the interviews that provide some answers to these questions. Our end goal is to distill from the interviews an over-arching narrative that goes beyond the experiences of individual researchers, and that provides an overall impression of what made NLG the field that it is today.
